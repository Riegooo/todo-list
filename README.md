#  Todo List (Node.js CLI App)

A simple **command-line Todo List application** built using **Node.js** and **prompt-sync**.  
This project lets users:

- Add tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Remove tasks  
- Exit the program  

Created as part of my **JavaScript learning and practice**.
